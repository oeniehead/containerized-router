# containerized-router

Attempt at containerizing a router.

To run KPN demo: `sudo docker compose -f kpn-test-compose.yaml up`

To peek in ISP container: `sudo docker compose -f kpn-test-compose.yaml exec isp-kpn sh`

To peek in ingress container: `sudo docker compose -f kpn-test-compose.yaml exec ingress-kpn sh`

To build all containers: `sudo ./build-containers`

Status:
- IPv4 works over PPPoE
- IPv6 implementation started
  - ISP has Kea DHCPv6 server to do Prefix Delegation
  - ISP no longer has radvd, as it should not be required
  - Ingress has a dhcpcd config file to test with, but the DHCPv6 sollicitation packets get ignored by Kea or are getting dropped somewhere

Notes:
- Kea DDNS requires DDNS server (bind?) for DNS updates
- ISP connection must sync IPv6 prefix to DHCPv6 servers via backstage event bus
- Netavark has an example plugin that moves host network interfaces to the container namespace
